### In a nutshell

I thrive to always research until I find the **best solution** to a given problem. This led me to an extensive knowledge and experience in many fields such as Marketing, User Experience, Software Engineering and DevOps.

### I love software

I am [developer](https://github.com/incorrupt/) and power user, **I eat software for breakfast** and have signed up to so many web apps and forums that I always forget I have an account there - Big thanks to my password manager, I couldn't have done it without you!

I am always hanging around [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@romainbarissat), AppSumo, [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/iRomain), [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iRomain), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/iRomain/), etc. stalking for the latest exciting stuff!

### I love other stuff too!

I am a proud husband, dad, son, elder brother, uncle, godfather.

I love the Ocean and the Sea, so you will often find me underwater as I practice diving, [free diving](https://www.facebook.com/changodiving/photos/t.514307233/580509748797408/?type=3), snorkeling, spearfishing, [photography](https://www.instagram.com/iromain/). That's why I currently live in Phuket, Thailand.
